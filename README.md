## Introduction

This project provides an AI-powered chatbot that interacts with users based on the content of uploaded files. Users can upload files in various formats (such as PDF, DOCX, CSV, etc.), and the chatbot will process and analyze the content to answer questions related to the file.

## Architecture Diagram

Below is an overview of the architecture of the Azones Chat with File:

### Explanation:
The flowchart depicts a system designed to handle both text input and file uploads. The primary goal is to process, store, and retrieve semantically meaningful information to answer user queries efficiently.

1. **Upload File**: Users can upload various file formats such as `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.csv`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.md`, and `.docx`.

2. **Extract Content**: Extract text content from the file for processing

3. **Split into Chunks**: The text is split into smaller chunks for efficient processing.

4. **Mistral Embeddings**: These chunks are processed using the Mistral language model to generate embeddings (numerical representations of text).

5. **Pinecone Vector DB**: The embeddings are stored in the Pinecone vector database for high-speed similarity search.

6. **User Input**: The user asks the question related to the uploaded file.

7. **Semantic Search**: The user’s query is converted into embeddings, which are compared to stored embeddings to find the closest matches.

8. **Mistral LLM**: The most relevant text chunks are fed to the Mistral language model, generating answers to the user's query.

## Features

- Upload files in various formats (TXT, PDF, CSV, XLS, XLSX, MD, DOCX).

- Drag-and-drop file upload or browse functionality.

- Chatbot interaction based on file content.

- Real-time question answering and response from the AI chatbot.

- Option to download the chat history.

- Simple, user-friendly interface using Bootstrap for styling.


## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Vector Store**: Pinecone
- **LLM Model**: Mistral

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- Django 5.0.7
- Mistral AI Subscription

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AZONES-TECHNOLOGIES/Chat_with_File.git
   cd Chat_with_File
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
